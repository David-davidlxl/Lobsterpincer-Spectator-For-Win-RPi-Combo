[Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) is a **free, open source, and strong UCI chess engine** derived from Glaurung 2.1 that analyzes chess positions and computes the optimal moves.

Stockfish **does not include a graphical user interface** (GUI) that is required to display a chessboard and to make it easy to input moves. Several [Free GUIs](Download-and-usage#free) are developed independently from Stockfish and are available online. 
**Read the documentation for your GUI** of choice for information about how to use Stockfish with it.
